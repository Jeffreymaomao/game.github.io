Visualization of the motion of photon near by Schwarzschild black hole. Using Schwarzschild metirc derive the Gravitational lensing formula
$$\cfrac{du}{d\phi}-u = \cfrac{3GM}{c^2}u^2,\quad u=\cfrac{1}{r},$$
which is a non-linear ODE.

In the course "**General Physics Experiment (I)**" that I took in the first semester of the junior year, we need to make a simple game that user can manipulate the position and motion of the ball by drag it. Therefore I wrote this simple game using some web language. In the web app, every ball following the motion described by
$$\displaystyle \cfrac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} = -\cfrac{b}{m} \cfrac{d\vec{r}}{dt}, \quad b>0,$$
where $\vec{r}$ is the postion vector of the ball, $m$ is the mass of the ball and $b$ is drag coefficient.

we need to make a final project with a simple game. The language we use in the course is `Lua`. 
However, making a web app is more convenient for user, I wrote this simple game using some web language.
